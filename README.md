# html-portfolio

# Initial intent

create a lightweight portfolio website in JavaScript, HTML and CSS/SASS

# plan

I knew from the start that I wanted to use a canvas element as in my Hero section as I have been experimenting with the generative art library p5.js. However, I didn't wireframe my site as I had an understanding of what I wanted to make but wanted room to experiment.

From there I listed our the sections that I wanted to have displayed and worked to make the site accessible for mobile and desktop browsers. The key tools to help with this were clamp() for modifying text size and flexbox for positioning elements.

# What I learnt

This was the first time I obtained a domain for my site and linked in to my hosting service. It was not difficult but a fulfilling and empowering experience: making, hosting and naming my own site.

Also, it was lots of fun working with canvas and find the particle animation particularly pleasing to watch.
